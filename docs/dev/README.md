# Developing Cluster Version Operator

> :warning: This document only covers the basic development, building and testing tasks. For information about
> concepts used and implemented in CVO, please see the
> [dev-guide in the openshift/enhancements repository](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/tree/master/dev-guide/cluster-version-operator).

## Building CVO

### Building the CVO binary

```console
$ make build
hack/build-go.sh
Using version from git...
Building github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator (v1.0.0-942-g59e0826f-dirty)
```

### Building the CVO image

The [`hack/build-image.sh`](../../hack/build-image.sh) script builds a local CVO image:

```console
$ ./hack/build-image.sh
INFO: Using version from git...
...
[2/2] COMMIT cluster-version-operator:v1.0.0-942-g59e0826f-dirty
--> 98ff149964f
Successfully tagged localhost/cluster-version-operator:v1.0.0-942-g59e0826f-dirty
```

### Publishing a development CVO image

The [`hack/push-image.sh`](../../hack/push-image.sh) script publishes
a [locally-built CVO image](#building-the-cvo-image) to a remote repository:

```console
$ REPO=<your personal repo, such as quay.io/login> ./hack/push-image.sh
```

This pushes `${VERSION}` and `latest` tags to `${REPO}/origin-cluster-version-operator`, where `${VERSION}` encodes the
Git commit used to build the image.

### Building and publishing a release payload image with development CVO

After publishing a [development CVO image](#publishing-a-development-cvo-image), you can build a release payload image
that will contain all manifests from an existing release payload and the development CVO binary:

```console
$ oc adm release new --from-release=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.11.18-x86_64 \
                     --to-image-base=${REPO}/origin-cluster-version-operator:latest \
                     --to-image=${REPO}/ocp-release:latest
```

## Testing CVO

### Unit tests

Run `make test` to execute all unit tests.

### Integration tests

Run `make integration-test` to execute integration tests against an OpenShift cluster. It requires `$KUBECONFIG` with
administrator credentials. Only execute integration tests against disposable testing clusters.

```console
$ export KUBECONFIG=<admin kubeconfig path>
$ make integration-test
```

### Replace cluster's CVO with development CVO release payload image

After publishing
a [release payload image with development CVO](#building-and-publishing-a-release-payload-image-with-development-cvo),
you can inject its pullspec into the `cluster-version-operator` Deployment in an existing cluster. Only do this against
disposable testing clusters.

```console
$ pullspec=${REPO}/ocp-release:latest

$ imagePatch='{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image","value":"'"$pullspec"'"}'
$ releaseImageArgPatch='{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/1","value":"--release-image='"$pullspec"'"}'
$ oc patch -n openshift-cluster-version deployment cluster-version-operator --type json --patch="[$imagePatch,$releaseImageArgPatch]"
deployment.apps/cluster-version-operator patched
```
